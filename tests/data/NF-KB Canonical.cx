Two signaling pathways lead to the activation of NF-kB, known as the classical (canonical) pathway and the non-canonical (alternative) pathway. The common regulatory step is activation of an IkB kinase (IKK) complex consisting of catalytic kinase subunits (IKKalpha and/or IKKbeta) and the regulatory non-enzymatic scaffold protein NEMO (NF-kB essential modulator also known as IKKgamma). Activation of NF-kB dimers is due to IKK-mediated phosphorylation-induced proteasomal degradation of IkB, enabling the active NF-kB transcription factor subunits to translocate to the nucleus and induce target gene expression. The canonical NF-kB pathway is induced by several signals including antigens, TLR ligands and cytokines such as TNF. It uses a wide variety of signaling adaptors to engage and activate the IKKbeta subunit of the IKK complex. IKKbeta phosphorylation of classical IkB proteins bound to NF-kB dimers such as p50-p65 results in ubiquitination (Ub) of IkB and proteasome-induced degradation."}, {"n":"organism","v":"Homo Sapiens (human)"}, {"n":"rightsHolder","v":"Prof. Gianni Cesareni"}, {"n":"rights","v":"Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)"}, {"n":"reference","v":"<div>Perfetto L., <i>et al.</i></div><div><b>SIGNOR: a database of causal relationships between biological entities</b><i>.</i></div><div>Nucleic Acids Res. 2016 Jan 4;44(D1):D548-54</div><div><span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv1048\" target=\"_blank\">doi: 10.1093/nar/gkv1048</a></span></div>"}, {"n":"version","v":"17-Aug-2021"}, {"n":"networkType","v":["pathway","Signalling Pathway"],"d":"list_of_string"}, {"n":"prov:wasGeneratedBy","v":"<a href=\"https://github.com/ndexcontent/ndexsignorloader\">ndexsignorloader 1.1.1</a>"}, {"n":"__normalizationversion","v":"0.1"}, {"n":"prov:wasDerivedFrom","v":"https://signor.uniroma2.it/pathway_browser.php?organism=&pathway_list=SIGNOR-NFKBC"}]},
